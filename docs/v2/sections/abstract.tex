\begin{abstract}
    This document describes the steps taken to add new features to the past work named \emph{Virtual Environment for Individual-Based Modeling - Part I}. As this work mainly consists of a continuation of that previous version of this Agent-Based Modeling project, the same assumptions regarding the behavioral aspects of the waterbirds within some lagoons in the tropics are considered to build a more stable, featured \emph{virtualized} system | a simulation. Among these newly-implemented features, figure the use of a \emph{dynamical} environment and different types of waterbird species to study their interactions with the system.

    Given that the project is built upon some advanced programming techniques, this document also reports on the technical aspects, namely procedural methods (algorithms, logics), applied to carry out the current release of the project. And finally, the results are openly discussed while giving an overview of encountered impediments and their possibly corresponding solutions.
