    \section{Code Repository}\label{sec:code-repo}
    All the code implemented during the execution of the prototype described in this report is available on the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/systemsecologygroup/BirdsABM}{github.com/systemsecologygroup/BirdsABM}.

    \section{Understand the repository}\label{sec:understand-repo}
    It is highly recommended to check and read the markdown files (e.g. \emph{README.md}) to encourage further understanding of every part of the repository. It is a self-sufficient, self-explanatory repository where every taken step is detailed with sustainable reasons.

    We also try to follow the best practices by using the recommendations of the open-source community. For example, observe how we use the commit messages, the file structures, the naming conventions, and so forth.

    Finally, we use up-to-date tools and software so that we can take advantage
    of their fully-available features.

    \section{Access VE Part I}\label{sec:access-ve1}
    The documentation for the first version of the virtual environment prototype is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/systemsecologygroup/BirdsABM/dist}{github.com/systemsecologygroup/BirdsABM/dist} under the name \emph{ve-ibm.draft@ju.pdf}. Consider reading it to catch the story behind how and why it all started.

    \section{The Python Scripts}\label{sec:python-scripts}
    The Python scripts for this version of the virtual environment prototype are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/systemsecologygroup/BirdsABM/src/notebooks}{github.com/systemsecologygroup/BirdsABM/src/notebooks} starting from the \emph{main.py} file.
