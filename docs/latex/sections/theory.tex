\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Waterbirds and Environmental Factors}
 Tropical coastal lagoons are shallow aquatic ecosystems located at the boundary between terrestrial and marine environments \cite{tavares2015environmental}. The high environmental heterogeneity of coastal lagoons, in both temporal and spatial scales, provides habitats for aquatic bird species with different ecological needs \cite{ntiamoa1998water, paracuellos2004factors, tavares2013inventory}. These habitats are mainly characterized by seven environmental variables and classified into three groups:
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item \emph{structural}: vegetation height, lagoon size and water depth;
     \item \emph{hydrochemical}: water salinity and pH;
     \item \emph{anthropogenic}: livestock grazing pressure and distance from human settlements;
 \end{enumerate}
and water depth is the most important variable influencing the waterbird assemblage \cite{tavares2015environmental}.

 The aquatic birds or \emph{waterbirds} inhabiting the coastal lagoons were, according to a survey conducted by Tavares D.C. et al in 2015 \cite{tavares2015environmental}, grouped into guilds\footnote{The guild concept was proposed by Blondel in 2003 \cite{blondel2003guilds}.} reflecting species' foraging habits and morphology. The six identified guilds were: diving birds (grebes), dabbling ducks (belonging to the genera Dendrocygna and Anas), large wading birds (herons, egrets and storks), vegetation gleaners (jacanas and gallinules), fishing birds (gulls and terns) and small wading birds \cite{tavares2014variaccao}.

\subsection{Agent-Based Modeling}
Agent-Based Models are computational simulation models that involve many discrete agents \cite{ago2019abm}. This computational simulation is usually based on intense processings and algorithmic calculations due to the fact the typical context in which the ABM is used is to study the collective behaviour of large number of components or agents.

An \emph{agent} is a component or an entitiy of the system and contains usually the following properties: internal states, spatial locations, interaction with the environment, interaction with each other, behaviour rules, adaptation and evolution. Depending on the goal of the ABM, some additional properties may or not be incorporated into the model. For instance, certain agents can be attributed the role of \emph{central controllers}.

The code implementation of an ABM can particularly be as heavy as its model complexity increases. Hence, it is viable to start off with some uncomplicated settings and assumptions in order to favour a straightforward analysis of the results that are obtained after running the simulation. Afterwards, one can subsequently tranform the model by adding more complexities. On the other hand, from a programming point of view, the code maintenance and organization are a relevant factor that contributes to debug relatively faster as the amount of coding increases.
