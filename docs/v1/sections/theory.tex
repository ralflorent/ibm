\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Waterbirds and Environmental Factors}
Tropical coastal lagoons are shallow aquatic ecosystems located at the boundary between terrestrial and marine environments \cite{tavares2015environmental}. The high environmental heterogeneity of coastal lagoons, in both temporal and spatial scales, provides habitats for aquatic bird species with different ecological needs \cite{ntiamoa1998water, paracuellos2004factors, tavares2013inventory}. Seven environmental variables mainly characterize these habitats and classified into three groups:
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item \emph{structural}: vegetation height, lagoon size and water depth;
     \item \emph{hydrochemical}: water salinity and pH;
     \item \emph{anthropogenic}: livestock grazing pressure and distance from human settlements;
 \end{enumerate}
and water depth is the most important variable influencing the waterbird assemblage \cite{tavares2015environmental}.

The aquatic birds or \emph{waterbirds} inhabiting the coastal lagoons were, according to a survey conducted by Tavares D.C. et al. in 2015 \cite{tavares2015environmental}, grouped into guilds\footnote{ Blondel proposed the guild concept in 2003 \cite{blondel2003guilds}.} reflecting species' foraging habits and morphology. The six identified guilds were: diving birds (grebes), dabbling ducks (belonging to the genera Dendrocygna and Anas), large wading birds (herons, egrets, and storks), vegetation gleaners (jacanas and gallinules), fishing birds (gulls and terns) and small wading birds \cite{tavares2014variaccao}.

\subsection{Agent-Based Modeling}
Agent-Based Models are computational simulation models that involve many discrete agents \cite{ago2019abm}. This computational simulation is usually based on intense processing and algorithmic calculations due to the fact the typical context in which the ABM is used is to study the collective behavior of a large number of components or agents.

An \emph{agent} is a component or an entity of the system and usually contains the following properties: internal states, spatial locations, interaction with the environment, interaction with each other, behavior rules, adaptation and evolution. Depending on the goal of the ABM, some additional properties may or not be incorporated into the model. For instance, specific agents can be attributed to the role of \emph{central controllers}.

The code implementation of an ABM can particularly be as heavy as its model complexity increases. Hence, it is viable to start with some uncomplicated settings and assumptions to favor a straightforward analysis of the results that are obtained after running the simulation. Afterward, one can subsequently transform the model by adding more complexities. On the other hand, from a programming point of view, the code maintenance and organization are a relevant factor that contributes to debug relatively faster as the amount of coding increases.
